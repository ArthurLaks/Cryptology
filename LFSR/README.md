Here is the assignment:

Implement LFSR encryption and decryption at the bit level. Your implemention should closely follow
the details of the method as it was discussed in class and is discussed in the text. Your program should
read from a file and produce an encrypted binary file (not a text file of 0’s and 1’s - that’s too inefficient
with space.)
