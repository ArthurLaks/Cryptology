Here is the assignment for this project:

In this project the plan is to write a program which will aid in the cryptanalysis of Vigenere type ciphers.
A variety of techniques are at your disposal: techniques for the determination of key length, verification
of suspected key length by computing ICâ€™s for substrings, etc., determination of key characters by best
fit shifts on substrings, and so on. Whether a definite key length is found or not, possibly strategies
exist for exhausing ngrams of consecutive key characters to yield meaningful plaintext. All of these
techniques should be as automated as possible. The user should not have to offer very much interaction.
The points will range somewhere in the interval 60-100 depending on how well your program performs
on sample Vigenere ciphers.

It works imperfectly. It will usually guess a keyword that is almost correct, but sometimes it will be twice
long as the correct one, the second half a near repition of the first half.
