The assignment for this project is to implement the rabin cryptosystem.
I did so using the gmp with the c++ interface.
The program encrypts an input file, block by block.
Decrypting a file produces four candidate decyrptions.

Unfortunately, I have not gotten this project to work properly and none of the candidate decryptions will match the plaintext.
